/**
 * Kitten domain core types.
 *
 * This module is the stable, protocol-free heart of the app (ADR-003). It holds
 * the normalized session model, the domain event union the reducer consumes, and
 * the hand-off data shapes. It imports NOTHING from the ACP SDK or any I/O layer:
 * the Agent Adapter Layer (`src/agent`) owns translation of ACP wire types into
 * these domain types, so no protocol churn leaks into the core.
 *
 * Type shapes follow the TechSpec "Data Models" and "Core Interfaces" sections.
